HumanApi
========

HumanApi is a project exploring the browser as a platform in a broader sense.
Besides the fact that we are running browsers on desktop computers, laptops and 
mobile phones what is really stopping us from using browser on other devices.

At the same time "traditional" browsers only communicate with very specific 
data source - in most cases webservices. HumanApi is exploring the potential
of letting the browser communicate with real hardware as well ar webservices.

This github project is the home of code for prototypes, API implementations
and suggestions.
